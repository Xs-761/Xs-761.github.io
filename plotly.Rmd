# Examples of Plotly
```{r Load Packages, include=FALSE}
  library(tidyverse)
  library(p8105.datasets)
  library(plotly)
  library(flexdashboard)
```

```{r}
  data("nyc_airbnb")
  nyc_airbnb = 
    nyc_airbnb |> 
    mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) |>
    select(
      neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) |>
    filter(
      !is.na(rating), 
      neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
      room_type == "Entire home/apt",
      price %in% 100:500)
```

## Plotly Plots

### Scatterplot
```{r}
  nyc_airbnb |>
    mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating)) |> 
    plot_ly(
      x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
      color = ~price, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5)
```

### Boxplot
```{r}
  nyc_airbnb |> 
    mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) |> 
      plot_ly(y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```

### Barplot
```{r}
  nyc_airbnb |> 
    count(neighbourhood) |> 
      mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) |> 
        plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")
```

### ggplotly
```{r}
  ggscatter = 
    nyc_airbnb %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=lat, y=long, color=price)) +
    geom_point()
  ggplotly(ggscatter)
```

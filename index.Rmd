### About Me

```         
    Hi! I’m Enju Zhang, a passionate data analyst currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Biostatistics at Columbia University expecting to graduate in May.2025. I specialize in applying statistical methods and programming to solve real-world problems in clinical research and public health.
    I bring hands-on experience from internships at BojiMed, Alibaba, and PwC, where I contributed to clinical trial data processing (CDISC, ADaM, SDTM), business analytics, and data privacy compliance. My technical toolkit includes SAS, R, Python, SQL, and Tableau, and I’m certified in advanced SAS and IBM Data Analytics.
    My career goal is to work in a data analytics role at a Pharmaceutical or CRO company, where I can contribute to evidence-based healthcare solutions using data-driven insights.
